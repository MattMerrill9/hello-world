<h1>Project #1: Bill of Details and Network Diagrams for a Warehouse LAN</h1>

<p>Projects that don't meet these minimum specs will not be accepted
and will be docked daily for late submit until they do.  
Please get any questions answered in class well before the due date.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Dlv #1 is two printed pages, one with only the wall plan for the warehouse printed to scale and the
  other with a network rack printed to scale.  The front wall, with the entrance is 8 3/4 inches from the rear wall of the
  warehouse which is 6 inches across, nothing other will be accepted. 
  Bring the printed pages to class to be collected on the due date.
  Put the two pages in a single pdf and attach it to an email to before class on the due date. </li>
  <li>Dlv #2 Required Parts:  1) Cover page describing the project. 2) Summary of purchase costs by vendor. 
  3) Summary of recurring costs by vendor or utility. 
      4) Warehouse Floorplan. 5) Network Rack Diagram. 6) Purchase orders for each vendor.</li>
  <li>Projects that do not have separate purchase orders prepared for each of the suppliers of hardware,
  software, and services will be rejected at first submission.  
  Make sure to show the amount due for each supplier on their purchase order
  and also on the summaries of up-front purchase.  
    It is not sufficient to provide one spreadsheet with a column for supplier. 
	Excel has templates for purchase orders.</li>
  <li>Summarize up-front and recurring costs separately. Projects that do not
provide these summaries in the customary format will be rejected at first submission.   
The Boss wants to be able to compare your up-front and on-going costs with others without getting out a calculator!  </li>
  <li>Make sure the printed diagrams fill the pages and are easily usable
  as printed.  The printed dimensions of the warehouse walls must be 8 3/4 X 6 inches.  
  Make 'skeletons' of your floorplan and rack diagram
	and try printing them _before_  putting much effort into the details and try printing them.
	Projects that can't be read as printed without a magnifier or do not fit on the printed page will be rejected at
	first submit  </li>
  <li>On the floor plan, after drawing the walls place telecomm outlet symbols on the walls where each ethernet jack will 
      be placed.  Place them to avoid pulling jumpers along the wall, around a corner, or over the floor to connect equipment.  
	  After
	  the telecomm outlets have been placed, put a wall segment in the network room to represent the rack, place a connection point on it 
	  and move it to the layer with the Telecomm outlets (data and flow terminals), then lock the walls and turn off their snap and glue.  
	  Use straight connectors between the connection point in the network closet and the telecomm outlets, and format
	  them with curved bends.  Represent the bundles and drop wires separately by bundling together the drops or
	  by using a thicker connector to represent the bundle and peel each drop off it.  Do not draw bundles or drops on top of
      the walls, keep them inside the premises and clearly visible.	  </li>
  <li>After placing equipment on the rack diagram, place connection points where each jumper connects to equipment or patch panel.  
    <strong>Use callouts or other neat technique to label each ethernet port with its
   IP assignment.  Do not label the jumpers. </strong>  Format straight connectors with curved bends for jumpers,
   not thin or with right-angled bends.     Avoid crossed connectors, kinks, and extra bends to make a neat drawing.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Two copies of your project are due:  1) A neatly printed copy _not_ in a binder or folder
or any kind, stapled at the upper left corner (instructor will have a heavy duty stapler if needed); 
2) An 'electronic' copy as a single pdf that contains
all requested parts: Floor plan with furnishings, premises wiring, and wall jacks; Rack diagram  
clearly indicating the DMZ and IP addresses; Purchase Orders; and an accurate Summary of Upfront and Ongoing Costs.  
 Bring the printed copy to class on the due date
and attach the electronic copy to an email to the instructor before class on the due date.  </p>

<p>If you want critique and feedback for your project, bring it to class or submit a pdf via email at least five days before the due date.
 A max 15 points may be earned if a project is resubmitted so try for all 
 points on the first submit.    </p>


<h2>Add This Project to Your Portfolio</h2>

<p>The project makes an excellent entry in a graduate's portfolio at LinkedIn and to show to a
technical interviewer.  Be prepared to answer questions
about it, maybe discuss other options, or to sit and demonstrate the skills.  
I like hearing through the year that
showing a good LAN or HOL - Hands on Linux project helped get a student into a career.</p>

<h2>Honor</h2>

<p><strong>This is 100% an Individual Project.  It is not a group or team
project </strong>.   
Learning to use Visio or other CAD tool, an ability to read and
follow instructions, and getting questions answered are part of this exercise.  
Technical skills are not developed by watching others do them and this is an 
opportunity to practice and develop technical skills and learn about costs and capabilities of LAN components. </p>

<p>Every key stroke and mouse click should be from
the student submitting the project. Do not submit any portion of any files from another student, 
in any degree of completion, as your own, with or without changes.  
Never give another student your files in any degree of completion! 
A lamer/cheat who can't do this work is likely to submit your work as his or 
her own and you'll be dragged into an honor proceeding for 'facilitating
academic dishonesty'.  </p> 

<p>If another students wants to 
see your project, show it only if you'd like, and help by answering questions.  
Helping others learn the tools or about the products involved in the project is a very Ram thing to do, 
will make more winners on our team, and is one of the best ways of learning more!  
Students are welcome to discuss the project and work with others, 
but each of them should be working at their own PC or notebook and never share the files involved, 
in any degree of completion, or touch another student's keys or mouse.  
</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/201908INFO300MemoFTB.html" target="Illustration"><strong>Memo From The Boss</strong></a>.  Read it with a highlighter
 and come up with an accurate Bill of Details for the upfront purchase and recurring costs 
 for running the system.</p>
 
 <p>Specs for the project are delivered here, in the 'memo from the boss' link above, and 
some verbally in class.   There are a couple of weeks to get questions answered in class, so
please start early. Do not make up specifications or substitute another rack
diagram or floorplan.  I suggest that you design and detail other LAN projects of your 
own _after_ this project has been completed so that you have more than one to show in your portfolio.  </p>

<p>For many students, this is the first time considering what to buy or how
hardware and software are priced and maintained.  Looking for equipment that meets specs 
 is an excellent way to learn. </p>
 <p>It is better to buy most equipment from one or a couple of well-respected suppliers 
 than it is to google separately for each component and make a big stack
 of of purchase orders to unknown entities each with one or two components. 
CDW, Dell, HP, Tiger Direct, Walmart, and others can source almost all the equipment
on one purchase order. </p>

<p>Gain product knowledge from the excellent descriptions and specifications at websites 
like dell.com, hp.com, cdi.com, cdw.com, blackbox.com, tigerdirect.com, or other on-line sources.  
Ask the instructor questions about what you find and the suitability for the LAN at hand,
and the result will be a pro-quality piece for your portfolio.  
 (We used to bring a stack of dozens of 'trade rags' to class for students to learn about products
 -- now the web is a much more accessible source.)  </p>


<p>The network rack is put together similar to the DMZ sketched on the board in class, 
and another sketch is included in the Memo From The Boss just below. </p>


<p>The rack-mounted servers should be identical,
each with a TByte of RAIDed DAS and 
rigged with at least three ethernet ports, so that any of them
can take over the role of any of the others when a server fails.  
If you find a good deal on a server that doesn't have three or more ethernet ports
make sure it has an expansion slot for a pci or pci-express dual or quad port ethernet adapter.
</p>
<p>
The sketch shows
the servers as Application, Database, DMZ/Proxy, and Backup Servers.  
The three 'working' servers are synch'd to the backup server on the rack,
and also to a backup server at the software house's secure hotsite via secure internet.  
In the event of the failure of one of the servers, or a local or regional
disaster, there is a well-rehearsed procedure
to change a couple of IP addresses and start appropriate services
on one of hot backup servers so business can continue.   </p>


<p>Microsoft Visio is required for the floorplan and rack diagrams. 
It's a component of MS Office Pro, and is a de facto standard tool for all kinds of diagrams in business, IS, and IT.  
It's available free thru the MSDNAA for students in INFO300.  
Please do not get the limited-use, free download from Microsoft's public site, do get the real Pro version from MSDNAA. 
Visio will also be used again in 
INFO361-Analysis &amp; Design, INFO364-Database, and INFO465-Projects and in the
advanced courses in all our tracks. 

Don't wimp out and use the Excel, Word, or PowerPoint drawing tools because they're all you know! 
The job will be much more difficult since you'll have to invent your own shapes and
the diagrams won't be very Pro in appearance.</p>
<p>
Excel, or other spreadsheet, makes it easy to do the Purchase Orders, there are templates built-in for them.
A spreadsheet is also useful for the  summaries of
up-front costs and operating expenses.   
Most students put the final document
together in Word and copy/paste the Visio diagrams and Excel bill of
details into  it, then export it to a pdf to make it easy for the boss,
or a technical interviewer or manager, to use the document without 
owning Excel, Word, or Visio. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here are <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/201801INFO300LANExamples2.shtml">Examples of Winning LAN Projects</a>.  These show a complete 
set of documents and most of another project that Aced the assignment, and a few other drawings that
show some common problems that cause loss of points.</p>	


<p>Here are some <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/Project1Examples/">Examples</a>
of projects including some that miss points.

<strong>Please note: These examples may not show the separate purchase orders required for this semester's project! </strong> 
</p>
<p>A neatly done screenshot of a 'shopping cart' from an on-line merchant is most welcome and if legible will 
substitute for that supplier's purchase order. </p>
<p> Hand-drawn diagrams, or hand-drawn marks on the 
printed copy, are not acceptable.  Projects will be rejected if the printed copies are absent or 
not politely formatted, for example with font too large or a column too narrow to fit a column of 
extended costs without wrapping on a line, or without the customary columns.</p>


<h4>Tips for Pro Work:</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Very important: <strong>Keep the printed copy that you will submit in class in mind
  as you begin work! </strong> Don't wait until the
very last minute to make your first printed copy!  Print at least one copy before you 
put a lot of work into your diagrams to make sure they fill the printed page
and that all IP assignments and features such as telecom outlets are clearly legible!  
Projects will be rejected if elements do not 
fit on the printed page, if diagrams are too small to read
without a magnifier, or lines of summary documents that span across pages. 
 If your printer fails at the final copy, please deliver an earlier printing
to avoid loss of points until a well-formatted document is delivered.</li>

<li>Think about the printed output required!  The printed copy of your project
is of the essence!  If you don't have a color printer don't depend on color to get your details across. 
Make sure everything fits on the printed pages for the Bill of Details, floorplan, and rack diagram!
Make sure the columns of your purchase orders and summary are wide enough to print the dollar
amounts without wrapping them.  Make sure everything is legible without a magnifier.</li>

<li>Be careful when choosing the starting project from the options Visio presents.
If you choose something like 'floor plan' the scale will be set wrong for a rack diagram.  
If you choose 'rack diagram' the scale will be wrong for a floor plan. 
Make sure _as you __start__ your drawing_ that the scale is appropriate and that your drawing will 
be usable on the printed page or pdf.  
</li>

 <li>For Engineering Quality drawings: Learn to 'scale the drawing' so that graphics are the appropriate
size and the dimensions printed are accurate.  
The drawing from The Boss, scanned from an 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper, pretty much fills the page and 
doesn't usually require changing from Visio's default scaling factor to make a good-looking diagram.
Marks on the drawing show the scale.  
<br><br>If you want to make measurements exact use
Visio's Design -&gt; Page Setup flyout -&gt; Drawing Scale tool to set the scale exactly.  
It's about .1 inch, 10 pixels, to a foot.  Use Custom Scale to adapt to a hand-drawn diagram.
Another approach is to add a line to the drawing, size it to the longest measurement on the drawing
on the background, then scale the drawing to fit it exactly...
</li>


 <li>Use 'rulers' to help align your walls and objects.  Drag them into the diagram from
  the rulers at the edges.  Shapes will snap to rulers unless 'snap to' has been turned off.
  </li>

  
    <li>Shapes important for the assignment as demo'd in class are: 
	Maps &amp; Fooorplans -&gt; Building &amp; Walls, and Electrical and Telecom;
    Network -&gt; Rack Mounted Equipment.  Callouts for labelling ip addresses annd other details, 
	are in the default set of shapes on earlier versions of Visio, have been moved to 'Extras' for the latest version.</li>
	
	<li>Getting shapes for equipment from VisioCafe.com is a really good idea!   You can get all 
		your points for this project with generic shapes from Visio, but rack diagrams where
		all components are from VisioCafe are the best looking if they're accurately drawn
		and will really pop for the instructor or technical interviewer who's grading your
		documents relative to all they've seen. </li>  

 
<li>Use Layers to your advantage: Start from the background and work up, locking each
layer as it's completed.  Almost 100% of problems with placing connection points and connectors
are because too many layers are left unlocked without snap-to disabled.  
Complex diagrams without layers are unmanageable.  Visio automagically creates
a layer for each of the shape templates used...
 </li>

  <li>Make sure your floor plan is a faithful representation of the
floor plan sketched by The Boss, all proportions exactly  resembling the sketch.
Don't submit a diagram where the walls appear to be several feet thick, join at odd angles,
make 'blind hallways', or otherwise don't match the Boss' sketch.  

<br><br>'Tracing' is the pro's technique to ensure accurate dimensions:   
Most drawing application allow an image to be loaded onto a background layer so that
the app's drawing tools can be used to create objects that exactly resemble a photo or sketch.<br><br>
Use Visio's Insert dialog to put the boss' sketched floorplan  on a 
background layer of a page, then scale it to fill the page, rotate it
so that it is perfectly aligned with a 'ruler', and lock its layer.  When it's time to print the final
copy the background can be set to invisible -- or, some students get good results by keeping 
the boss' sloppy diagram and screening it or rendering it partially opaque. <br>



<br>With the background visible and locked, 
trace the outside walls using Visio's Walls, Shell &amp; Structure shapes:
Drag a Room or L-Shaped Room shape onto the drawing and size it to the rectangular or l-shaped 'envelope'
of the premises.  
<br><br>Add walls, doors, and windows to  to make a polished floorplan. 
Use the Curved Wall shape to trace curved wall segments.  Where there is a diagonal wall,
place the horizontal and vertical walls, then drag a wall onto the drawing and
snap its ends onto the horizontal and vertical. 

<br><br> 
When the walls, doors, and windows have been traced faithfully, lock their layers and 
 move on to place the desks, telecom connectors, 
premises wiring.  Lock the layers with these shapes and place the networked equipment on the drawing.  </li>

<li>Jumpers and drops: These may be drawn with the connection tool or by finding the appropriate
wiring shape.  For objects that don't have built-in connection points, 
place connection points accurately.
 Don't just draw lines with the drawing tool.   
 <strong>Use bold, straight connectors formatted with curved bends for jumpers and drops</strong> -- straight lines with sharp
 corners blend in with walls and rack components and detract from a professional look.<br><br>
Use a consistent call-out shape with finer, angled lines to clearly identify IP assignments on the rack.<br><br>
Label the ports, not the jumpers.  Place the call-out's connection point on the port being identified. 
Don't label the jumper wires with IP assignments, label the ethernet ports themselves to
avoid ambiguity.
 </li>
 <li><strong>Avoid crossed lines! </strong>
 Take care to avoid crossed lines in your diagrams.  Visio will accommodate crossed connectors 
 with  little 'bridges', 
 but clusters of them are obnoxious and indicate sloth of the diagrammer. 
 A Portfolio that abuses crossed lines will likely be pitched out of consideration.</li>
  <li>Zoom way in, 200-800%, to place details like connection points accurately.  
     400% is the highest zoom available in the pull-down, 
	 but typing 800 directly into the 'zoom box' will get 800%.  
     </li>
    <li>These diagrams cannot be _too_ detailed!  Tech interviewers
  _love_ to see, neat, highly detailed, &amp; accurate work.  They know it indicates
  intelligence, technical curiosity, and enjoyment of technical work. <br><br>They want to hire
  those rare applicants who take pleasure in a job well-done, 
  are self-actualizing tech skills, and enjoy it.  
  <br><br> To _really_ impress the hiring manager 
  take care to show clearly all the little details and their connections, like the UPSs,
  USB or SCSI connectors for the tape drives, every drop, and and every jumper in the LAN for
  phones, PCs, and printers.  If you can't do this clearly and neatly then don't
  attempt it, you'll be better off with a less-detailed, high-level diagram that's useful for the installers.  
  </li>
  
  <li>Do the work yourself and develop the skills.  Modelling skills are in high demand for network,
   database, use cases, state charts, or class diagrams!   
  A tech interviewer is cheat-savvy and 
  is likely to ask you to demo the tools for what's in your portfolio or resume and
  scoot you out the door if you can't do it.  Lots of students over
  the past decades have related to me that 
  the LAN Project in their portfolio got them past an early interview, and
  that their skills with technical drawing got them their job, sometimes immediately.
  
 </li>
 
If you're aiming for fine detail on the desks:  Make the arrangement for one desk to
include phone, pc, jumpers, and printer.  When you get it right, select the objects and 
join them together.  Then copy/paste the group to each desk.  
 


<li>Neatness _does_ count.  Sloppy bills of details or diagrams are not acceptable, will
be docked severely or rejected for scoring.  Rejected projects will lose a point for late submit
and a point per midnight passed before an acceptable document is delivered.  Every semester there are a few
sloppy, unprofessional documents presented and the instructor wishes there were none.  </li>

  <li>The intent of the floor plan is that it can be printed and handed to the installers
of office furniture and premises wiring for an error-free job.  
<br><br>
Suzy Smiley will take the
office floorplan and do the BOD for the contract furniture specialist on a separate agreement,
so please don't bother finding the prices for furniture.  

<br><br> Place Wall Jacks  where they're needed so that  
jumpers are not shown running across the floor or around corners to get to the desks. 
Make sure you're placing the office furniture and the telecomm jacks so that a short jumper, 6', can
easily connect.  Place the rear or side of desks a few inches from the wall near the jack. <br><br>
Be exceedingly clear about where each jack will be placed in the floorplan.  Make sure to add jacks and drops for the
network attached printers, the mailing machine, any other networked equipment.   <br><br>Use the 'telecom outlet' symbol
from Building Plans, Electrical and Telecom, one for each drop, do NOT use other shapes for the jacks! 

<br><br> If you really  want to impress the
user of your document, show the equipment on the desk or table and the jumper wire
that connects it to the jack in the wall, and show the #s on the patch panel and the 
IP assignments for the phone and PC on the desk. </li>

<li>The intent of the Purchase Orders is that they can be sent directly to each of the suppliers
without any other manipulation by The Boss.  It is not acceptable 
to print a single spreadsheet
that includes details from more than one supplier.  It is OK to use screen-shots showing the 
'shopping cart' for on-line suppliers, with their totals shown on the separate summary of
purchases -- these can be part of a very pro-appearing presentation.  <br><br>Fewer suppliers is better
than more suppliers, use well-known suppliers and name-brand components so it's easy to check specs and pricing
when your documents are graded.     </li>

<li>Detail lines on purchase orders and
summaries are required to be shown with at least the customary column headings: 
Description, Part#, Qty, Unit Cost, Extended Cost. <br><br>
A more pro-quality BOD will include a column before the description that ties it to the requirements
in the Memo or other documents about the project.  </li> 

<li>The intent of the Summaries is that they show separate, accurate summaries of up-front purchases
and recurring costs for installing and operating the LAN.   Include one line per supplier in the summaries, 
don't show all the details.  <br><br>
It is not acceptable to mix 'on-going' and 'up-front' costs in the same column or in the same 
section of the summary document.  
<br><br>
It _is_ desirable to add an annualized cost of maintenance as a separate column on the summary line for each component.
If you buy PCs with a long-term, on-site repair agreement (as from Dell, can't be beat) show this
on the BOD and include a statement about it in the recurring costs section.  
If a component doesn't have a stated maintenance cost a good estimate is 12% of the cost at purchase, annually.
Microsoft doesn't charge a 'maintenance fee' for their software, so it's a good idea to budget
for replacement in three to five years.</li> 


<li>Take time to learn the software before you start the drawing you'll submit. 
  Visio is a complex program but most of the controls to achieve a pro result are
  in the speed bar, or ribbon, at the top of the page.
 There are lots of excellent tutes for Visio, and a trip to a bookstore might
be a good idea if you need step-by-step instructions.   Most students are
able to pick up the tool and learn it using Visio's extensive and excellent
on-line tutorials and dynamic help.   </li>

<li>Investigate the Templates of shapes and decide which you'll use, then use
them consistently:  Maps &amp; Floorplans -&gt; Building &amp; Walls, and Electrical and Telecom;
    Network -&gt; Rack Mounted Equipment.  The callouts are in the default set of shapes
		on earlier versions of Visio, but have been moved to 'Extras' for the latest version. 

<br><br>For the best-looking results, check out VisioCafe.com, or the manufacturer's websites,
for Visio templates that exactly match the equipment on your purchase orders.    
The best-looking of these diagrams show front and rear views of the rack side-by-side with bold
connectors for jumpers and very clear call-outs to show the IP assignments.  
Servers generally have their ethernet connections at the rear,
switches at the front. 
<br><br>You can get also get all your points using the default Visio shapes with all connection points on the front,
as in the boss' sketch.  It doesn't exactly match reality, but it can make a pro-looking result.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
<strong>The printed copy is of the essence for this project. </strong> PDFs are for portfolio exhibits and not used for
scoring the project, but a missing pdf, or  multiple pdfs will result in 5 points lost.  
On the due date, bring a printed copy at the _beginning_ of class where I'll have a
heavy-duty stapler.  Please don't submit your project in a binder of any kind.  
Printed copies that are not delivered at the very beginning of class will be docked 2 points for late arrival 
and another point for each midnite passed until the printed copy is delivered.
Send an electronic copy of the printed document prior to class as <strong>one pdf</strong>,
preferably not zipped, attached to VCU-originated email to gasaunde-AT-vcu.edu.
